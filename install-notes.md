### Home Manager
As I installed home manager, this required two imperative steps: 
`sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager` 
`sudo nix-channel --update` 
Apparently this required me to use the stable channel for home manager? Need to look why this is, since I should be on nixos unstable
